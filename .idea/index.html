<p>In this project I am going to make a database that will file art that I have worked on over the years.
I aspire to be able to look up information including:
<ol>
    <ls>picture</ls></br>
    <ls>category</ls></br>
    <ls>time created</ls></br>
    <ls>whether or not it has been sold</ls></br>
</ol></p>
<p>in my goals I would also like to make it so that it links to a way to purchase said project and
have a slider to view things via timeline. </p>
